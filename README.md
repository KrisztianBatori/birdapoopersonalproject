# birdapoopersonalproject
The source code for my personal pet project, the Bird-A-Poo ios game.

I've made this game in my free time. It was my first attempt to create such a complex app.

There are things which I would do differently now, but I left everything as it was (only adding a few comments) to show what was my level at that time.

The videos are for demonstrations. If needed, I can bring a device on which the app is installed for further testing.
